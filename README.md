<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;">In this project I used Beautiful Soup to extract financial data like historical <b>share prices</b> and quarterly revenue reports from Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. After collecting the data I displayed it on a dashboard to identify patterns or trends using Plotly - another Python Library for data visualization. 
A company's stock share is a piece of the company; more precisely:<br><br>
<i>A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."</i><br><br>
Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. The stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges.
I used the  y-finance API to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock.
